## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Normalise.css

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

i got beter with using the width and max-width properties in css and i can use :root to define variables in css 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/assets/images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: hsl(30, 10%, 34%);
    --secondary-color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    --rose-heading: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
    --rose-body: hsl(330, 100%, 98%);
    --header-color: hsl(24, 5%, 18%);
    --border: 1px solid hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
}
```.

### Continued development
i was unable to perfect align the items under the Nutrition section so i will check out the review and see how others did theirs and i feel like my code has too many manipulation i was trying a lot of different things to see which one works best so i will try to simplify it
